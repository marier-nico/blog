Welcome to my blog, hopefully your journey to this far, far away corner of the Internet was not too troublesome. It's nice to meet you, finally, I've been waiting.

I'll be concise; no need to discuss at length why you came here, the important thing is that you made it. My name is Nicolas, and I'm currently studying computer science in university (how original). I like security and will take part in as many CTFs as I can fit into my schedule. I work for a software company while studying, it keeps things interesting, and I also play badminton or go skiing the rest of the time.

As you can see, my schedule is pretty packed. Fortunately, I am occasionally able to forget my various responsibilities and continue teaching myself programming concepts, languages, technologies or paradigms. I'm also interested in the many crafts surrounding programming itself, such as dev-ops and dev-tooling.

I'm passionate about making simple things that work well and are convenient. Often times, my work falls short of my expectations, but such is the process of improving at one's craft. I'm always looking for a new challenge and, given the time, I will fully invest my energy into trying to solve one such challenge.

You might be (rightly) wondering : "Gee, that's fun and all, but who cares? Why does this guy think he needs a blog anyway?" That is an astute observation, and I need this blog for no other reason than to keep an archive of past struggles and solutions. As you know, documentation is vital to software development and the hope is that by documenting issues and solutions on this blog, I will improve on my ability to write useful documentation. Making the blog public will force me to put some minimum amount of effort and thought into the process, so as to not make a fool of myself. If it turns out that I'm able to, by chance, help out a fellow human being with any given task through this blog, then I will also be satisfied.

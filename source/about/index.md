Welcome to my blog, hopefully your journey to this far, far away corner of
the Internet was not too troublesome. It's nice to meet you, finally, I've
been waiting.

I'll be concise; no need to discuss at length why you came here, the important
thing is that you made it. My name is Nicolas, and I'm currently studying
computer science in university (how original). I like security and will take
part in as many CTFs as I can fit into my schedule. I work for a software
company while studying, it keeps things interesting, and I also play badminton
or go skiing the rest of the time.

As you can see, my schedule is pretty packed. Fortunately, I am occasionally
able to forget my various responsibilities and continue teaching myself programming
concepts, languages, technologies or paradigms. I'm also interested in the many
crafts surrounding programming itself, such as dev-ops and dev-tooling.

I'm passionate about making simple things that work well and are convenient.
Often times, my work falls short of my expectations, but such is the process of
improving at one's craft. I'm always looking for a new challenge and, given the
time, I will fully invest my energy into trying to solve one such challenge.

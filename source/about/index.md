Welcome to my blog,

I'm currently studying computer science in university. I also try to teach myself things on my own time (because I find so many things interesting)! I love to share what I make and how I do it with others, so if anyone learns anything by using this blog, I'll certainly be very happy. Generally I tend to learn things that are more software-oriented, because that's what I'm the best with, but I also have an interest in hardware-related projects, such as things that use any sort of RaspberryPi.

These days I'm mostly doing quick projects when I can find a bit of free time, since between work and university, I'm quite busy! Those projects are still valuable to me though. I'm also taking part in some competitive events which are usually security related, but not always (like the csgames).

Outside of the software world, I generally enjoy sports, music (ask me about my audio setup!), reading and writing (hence this blog)!

Thanks for stopping by my humble little corner in this grand big web of things. I hope you have a pleasant stay and discover something new!
